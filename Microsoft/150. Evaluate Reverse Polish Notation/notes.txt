You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:

The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
There will not be any division by zero.
The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

Solution:
Approach 
1.We will use a stack and traverse the array from start.
2.Whenever an arr element is not any of the operators { +, - ,* , / } then we push element into the stack.
3.If arr is any operators then we pop 2 times from the stack and perform the operation with the 2 popped element.And then we push the result of operation into the stack again.
4.Repeat 1 and 2 for all elements of the array.
5.At last pop the element from the stack and print the Result
